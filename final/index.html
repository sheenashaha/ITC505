        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>In designing this webpage, I chose a clean and minimalistic layout to keep the focus on the Lights Out Challenge game itself. By removing any unnecessary distractions, I wanted to create an environment where users could easily interact with the game. The page structure is straightforward, which helps with readability and maintainability. I also opted to keep the HTML simple by linking external files for styling (`styles.css`) and functionality (`app.js`), ensuring a modular approach to the design.</p>
        <p>One important design decision was to include the dynamic update time in the footer. I used JavaScript to automatically fill in the last modified timestamp, providing the user with real-time information about when the page was last updated. This small feature adds a touch of interactivity and transparency. The game itself is powered by the `app.js` file, which holds all the necessary game logic, allowing the HTML to remain focused on structure and user experience, rather than combining both content and behavior in a single file.</p>
